# Project X: Student Marketplace for Academic & Research Projects

## Overview

**Project X** is a student-centric digital marketplace that addresses the lack of visibility, access, and monetization opportunities for student-created academic and technical projects. Students invest significant effort into capstones, course assignments, and mini research work that often remain unused post-evaluation. This platform aims to revive, share, and commercialize those efforts.

---

## Problem Statement

Despite the value of academic projects, they often go unseen and unused. Existing platforms like freelance marketplaces or GitHub are not suited to the academic context. The key issues include:

1. **Invisibility of Student Work**  
   Projects are stored privately and not reused after grading.

2. **Inefficient Knowledge Transfer**  
   Students struggle to find structured, credible reference material.

3. **Lack of Motivation and Monetization**  
   No direct way to earn from projects results in limited incentive to improve quality.

4. **Concerns About Quality and Credibility**  
   Without standardization, it’s hard to assess the scope, completeness, or value of shared work.

## Scope

The platform focuses on digital academic outputs, such as:

- Software projects
- Research reports
- Hardware schematics
- Datasets

It does not cover plagiarism detection, shipping of physical goods, or general freelancing.

---

## Opportunity

By creating a centralized academic marketplace with filters, categorization, peer review, and monetization options, Project X can:

- Enable real-world reuse of academic work
- Improve access to credible project references
- Help students build public portfolios and generate income
- Increase institutional visibility for innovation
